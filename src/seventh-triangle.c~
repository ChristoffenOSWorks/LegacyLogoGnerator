 * This is a Christoffen C specification file.

 * All code here is written by me, MGage Morgan, on the weekend of 1/2/2015.
 *
 * The Christoffen C is written in and compiled by the C programming language.
 * It is generated by the libcairo2 2D graphics library.
 *
 * Got it working on Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid Vervet."
 *
 * In order to do so, you need to use flags not defined on cairographics.org:
 *
 * You also need to include the direct path to the cairo.h file, for example:
 * #include "/usr/include/cairo/cairo.h"
 *
 * This software was compiled by Gage Morgan on October 3, 2015.
 * Thanks for support @ Christoffen Corporation.

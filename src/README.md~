# Christoffen Generator
This is the readme for the Christoffen Logo Generator.

The program has two reasons of existance. Firstly, it's a learning project for development head Gage Morgan to
learn the ropes of Cairo. The second reason is due to logo editing between Gage Morgan and Elijah Clark.

The initial goal of the program is to be able to generate a much cleaner version of the Christoffen Logo, with a 
much more modular design. The *modular* design comes from when Clark and Morgan needed the pieces of the logo separated. 
This tool generates multiple copies, so no more backups are needed.
